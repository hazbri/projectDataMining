 dedication

Most liked Tweet ever.  A tribute fit for a King.  
 sending you cookie

" correct, we love this"
 applying for low maintenance mutuals
 been sitting here debating between  and  for a few minutes

 nocturnal bird gets the fish
 you and all the other people who won't have to wait until morning to read this
 looked at your shoes knew it was you
 TOW they pull an all-nighter
" you don't have to be so formal, Twitter is fine"
 not down
 tell otis we feel personally addressed
 still celebrating 
 we'd be getting more if we were under that blanket

 Who do you think sent this Tweet? (Mercury)
 Didn't mean to treat you like this at the beginning of Pisces season
" Ok! It's you, Ethan"
 Us when someone throws a water bottle in the green recycling bin
 Well... you do Tweet about it every day
 Consider it a thought starter for the day
 yeah sure whatever makes you feel better
 Something fishy going on in that trident
 Don't stop him now
" Vitamin D is making your day better, promise"
 The only thing Saturn is gonna do is put a ring on it
 But life still goes on
 Don't judge a planet by its cover
 revenge for getting kicked out of the solar system
 Does this look red to you 
 Why can't we just blame it on Pluto
" Sorry, you've reached the Mercury defense squad"
"It's not Mercury, it's you"
 pics or it didn't happen
"Now you can add a Tweet to one you already Tweeted, faster! "
 best cover we've seen
 we support this
 just make sure your @ isn't cropped
 better late than never
 is there even a better talent
 toot it and Tweet it
 at least your thoughts are tangible here
" no more sonnets, we're freestylin"
 xo mutuals come through
 still typing
 MYOT the most important acronym
 we're on the same page then
 are you breaking up with us?
 We were hoping so that it could turn into a big chat
 Thanks for making the first move
 We're a perfect match
 is there someone else?
 We did! Did you give us the wrong number...
" oh we actually meant to say ""we like you"""
" In that case, ignore this Tweet"
 Giving you the confidence you need
 he told us to Tweet this
 to the moon and back
  You've got us for next year too
 still waiting for someone to DM us the plan
" us too, before we send them"
 You pick the place
 Rejection? Today of all days?
 But you love it
 Low blow on V-Day
 And if we meant as more?
 love you so much that we're speechless
 Didn't know we were at that level yet
 THOSE SCREENSHOTS WEREN'T REAL
" This is a conversation, here's a Sent you conversational hearts"
" intros complete, let's get dinner"
 we're always in the cards
 Real and true
 How can we show you?
 If you'll have us
we LIKE like you

 writer's block on Twitter hits different
 thank you
 Twitter
 who needs a study break alarm when you have BTS on push
 It can't have been that important
 what's Twitter?
 Reminder you have exams
 This is your Groundhog Day
 What if the tenth time's the charm 
 humbling
 It’s a medical mystery
" ""friends"""
 Tell 'em
 time to meet your mutuals
 IF THEY DON'T GET TWITTER THEY DON'T GET YOU
 decade of understanding
 Aquarius?
 they didn't teach us this in school
 it's the circle of life
 is this the wild berry flavor?
 You saved yourself a failed relationship
 hard to understand someone with a filter
 that's the tea
 
 always a mention away
 quite literally
 wouldn't happen
 that Tweet has sailed
 we get you
"If they don’t get Twitter, they don’t get you"
  When  sends you a screenshot of your tweet on an actual sign in New York in the th Ave &amp; th St. Subway Statio…
 no swiping on this Tweet  
 now we're all laughing  
 *holds up Tweet*  
" one Tweet, no problem  "
 more time to Tweet  
   
   
 that goal got you far  
" that's it, that's literally the Tweet  "
 This Tweet's an   
 we said yes!  
 follow us so we can DM you!
 depends what the cuddle precedes
 making out IS hooking up
 you know what else they call eye contact 
 well actually kissing is not a relationship
 What if we don’t have a Valentine anymore 
 it WAS but look what it started
 show us the rule book
 oops guess we lied during never have I ever
 yeah but a friendly one
 You never forget your first heartbreak Tweet
 One cheek or two?
 please don't she doesn't even know we went out last night
 if so then co-existing is hooking up
 people on the internet
 *do
 tell us we don't need to regret it
 Two arms open wide
 confirmed
 It's ok to wait
 can't Tweet their name it hurts too much
 It's a Saturday isn't this allowed
 don't know if we have time for that
 hugging is third base right
 rejection is rejection :/
kissing IS hooking up
ok it worked
test
 mutuals know best
 solid six more hours of Tweeting
 the golden rule
 should we reply through your publicist?
 And that person is not right for you anyways
 that's real love
 and then you got a reply about BTS from 
 strong return
 She was thinking about her own... Tweets
 It's research
 proud of this growth 
 Hatsune Miku
 never
 But we need to know what happens next
 Do you know who you are
 Is that a dating app?
 and a dash of glam
 they can never find out
 love to see it first
" but deep down we all know, don't we?"
 How your volume should look while scrolling:
 
 Didn't even get the blue tones in there
 Truly Groundhog Day every day on the timeline
 This Tweet is chaotic good on the alignment scale
 At your Twitter best. Good luck! 
 soup herb move on your part to warm your followers
"  Black History Month is HERE! This year, we’re also celebrating the pride and joy of our present! It's about connecting an…"
 and very controversial
 time to also do the end of January dance
 Exactly why we have Bookmarks
 Twitter fam makes things happen
 Friend: Let's catch up!Us: 
 
 oof this hurt
 we're not swerving
 Who approved that!?
 Snoozing until next month
" Just double-checked. Yup, still"
 Do you have evidence?
 earth keeps pulling the reverse card
 setting our alarm
 Only time will tell
 Booking a one way ticket to your universe
 We'll take a dare instead
 hottest take about this month
" and by our calculations, happy summer"
 January didn't listen to the golden rule
 no thank you
 Halloween is next decade

 Trying to Tweet February  into existence
 Soon
 Every day felt like its own January
 *cher voice* IF WE COULD SPEED UP TIME IF WE COULD FIND A WAY
 exactly how February feels rn
 so you could spin faster
 About to be the longest  hours
 it is in dog years
" If you work well under pressure, February is for you"
 On Mercury maybe
"Yes, it's still January"
" We don't watch TV, only television"
 lesson learned is not what they said
 thank you for your time
 you did good
 It's all fun and games until there's a big Tweet the size of a small Tweet
 Confidence is half the battle and you've locked that down
 Study the timeline. Pop quiz later
 Time to make this Tweet a home
 Yea you kinda have a point
 
 wildly accurate
 We played ourselves
 Scrolling time is its own battle
 
" please clap, everyone"
 Can't wait to turn  and not have a bedtime anymore
 You know where we'll be
 But we only spent  seconds in REM 
 One more Tweet and then your alarm is going off
 When nature becomes the white noise machine
 that's code for nap time
 Plan to get in eight hours
 Can't get much longer than  characters
 Someone found the loophole
 Say it in a Tweet
 ok np
 Let's not and say we did
 You can sleep now. We won't tell if you don't
 Nothing says hump day like a nap in the middle of the day
" wouldn't know, always have our Tweets on us"
 Ok maybe the Tweets were too good
 midnight breakfast &gt;
 Bobby's boss if you're reading this Tweet Bobby was just resting his eyes
" been a day, been a year"
 Exactly why we're telling you now
 zola of course
 Yeah we're snoozing the alarm again
 one more scroll
 we'll still be here
 sweet dreams
 gotta be on our game tomorrow
 That can continue
 until we wake up of course
 and an all-nighter later
" Calling it a night, early"
One more Tweet and then it’s bedtime
 a hero that Tweets among us
 literally love to see it
" elite Tweets, a mood"
 when in Rome
 not with that pic we won't
 every Tweet's a new page
" Always ""accidentally"" misspell by one letter"
 The people want it
 this Tweet's your receipt

 Coming in clutch with the ultimate solve
 Thinking about just cancelling our texting plan
 Trying to be better about it this year

 a quick soft block is an option
" Been ""it's not you it's me""-ed too many time"
 Are you shooting your shot?
 This is some advanced thinking
 Real contemplation hours
 leaving that on read
 Selective Retweeting is real

 Cringe and keep sending
 They're probably just gonna DM react then
 Thought we were friends

 Taking a cue from you this decade
 Whatever you can get!
